  <h1 class= "prologue-title">Prologue</h1>
  <h2 class = "prologue">The night is still, peaceful and quiet. The trees that surround you rustle with the slightest breeze, and the crickets silently chirp in the distance. A full moon wanes brightly in the starry-lit sky. However, something feels wrong—the air is freezing. It brings an icy, cold feeling that sends chills throughout your body. <br>
  <br>
  You glance up at the moon, hopeful for an answer. It still shines brightly but it gazes down on you almost expectantly. It’s telling you something and you’re itching to figure out what it wants. Just then, the path in front of you glows a little brighter and you step through the greenery to investigate.</h2>
